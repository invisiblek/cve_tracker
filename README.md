============

1. Use Python 3.2 or higher
2. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` (use pip3 if python2 is the default on your system)
3. Generate a GitHub personal access token [here](https://github.com/settings/tokens). You don't need to select any scopes, just give it a name.
4. Have access to a MongoDB instance and the IP address of the box.
5. Copy options.json.example to options.json and provide the token you added above along with the IP of the MongoDB server.
6. Seed your database initially by running `python seed.py`.
7. Once you're set up, run: `python app.py` to start the service. It listens on port 5000.
