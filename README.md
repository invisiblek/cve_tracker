============

1. Use Python 3.2 or higher
2. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` (use pip3 if python2 is the default on your system)
3. Generate a GitHub personal access token [here](https://github.com/settings/tokens). You don't need to select any scopes, just give it a name.
4. Copy options.json.example to options.json and provide the token you added above.
5. Once you're set up, run: `python app.py` to start the service. It listens on port 5000
